Boulder is a gem of Colorado and a thriving little melting pot of some of the world’s most top tier talent. From olympians to scientists and tech gurus to Fortune 500 CEOs, they can all be found in this town of just over 100,000 people. The active lifestyle, artsy culture, and progressive initiatives are what create such a high quality of living here and ultimately such an attractive place to live. The secret has been out for awhile now though and home prices have skyrocketed to some of the highest in the state making it not such a practical place to live. With cheaper housing, Boulder would easily move to the top of this list.

### 4. Golden

A lesser known suburb of Denver that often flies under the radar, Golden feels a world away from the big city as it sits nestled in between the mountains and the large plateau that separate it from the rest of the metropolitan region.

With a light rail system connecting this suburb to Denver, it’s an ideal place for commuters who are not yet ready to give up small town living.
