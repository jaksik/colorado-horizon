More than just hiking trails and farmer’s markets, the best places to live in Colorado are aslo home to some of the hottest economies and most innovative companies in the country. 

Most people are attracted to the state by its cute mountain towns and opportunity for outdoor adventure, but quickly turn to the front range for practicality once they realize the high cost of living in Colorado.

## What are the best places to live in Colorado?
Big cities, outdoorsy suburbs, and winding bike paths make up the best places to live in Colorado. 

With healthy living and a taste for culture being a staple amongst most towns in Colorado, you can’t go wrong regardless of where you decide to live.

After personally living in several towns around the state and extensively researching the determining factors of others such as cost of living, quality of life, and economic growth, I’ve put together this list to help others determine what might be the best place for them to live in Colorado.   

**These are the best places to live in Colorado:**

### 1. Colorado Springs

A thriving economy, quick access to the mountains, and having some of the most reasonably priced homes in the state make Colorado Springs the best place to live in Colorado. Also being home to the Garden of the Gods, Olympic Training Center, Air Force Academy, and Pikes Peak make this town a popular vacation destination and cultural hub. Colorado Springs is the cheapest place to live in Colorado where you can have quick access to the mountains without sacrificing the big city amenities.

### 2. Fort Collins

The perfect balance between development and conservation, Fort Collins offers a harmonious lifestyle that can be difficult to find anywhere else in the world. A short ride down one of the numerous bike paths here, past a few breweries and the university will be all that it takes show you why this is one of the most environmentaly friendly towns in the country. Located just an hour northeast of Estes Park and an hour south of Cheyenne, there’s ample opportunity for day trips and overnight camping trips from Fort Collins. With a bit more reasonalbe housing prices, this town would no doubt be #1 on this list. 

### 3. Boulder

A gem of Colorado, Boulder is a thriving little melting pot of some of the world’s most top tier talent. From olympians to sceintists, and tech gurus to Fortune 500 CEOs they can all be found in this town of just over 100,000. The active lifestlye, artsy culture, and progressive initiatives are what create such a high quality of living here and ultimately such an attractive place to live. However, the secret has been out for awhile now and home prices have sky rocketed to some of the highest in the state making it not such a practical place to live. Similar to Fort Collins, cheaper housing would bump this town up on our list.

### 4. Golden

A lesser known suburb of Denver that often flies under the radar, Golden feels a wold away from the big city as it sits nestled in the foothills inbetween the mountains and the large plateus that separate it from the rest of the metropolitan region. One of the original mining towns in Colorado, Golden has a rich history that sits in plain sight around the town in the form of historic buildings and museums which gives it a unique feeling of authenticity. With a light rail system connecting this suburb to the big city, it’s an ideal place for commuters who are not ready to give up mountain living.

### 5. Denver

The capital and largest city in the great state of Colorado, Denver boasts an outdoorsy culture, booming economy, thriving art scene, and quick mountain access that compares to very few other large cities. This has made Denver an outstanding city to live in and has ultimately caused the population to explode here over the past decade. Although healthy living is a staple of the culture here, this city is no exception to the common downsides of densely populated areas such as traffic and pollution, which is what brought Denver down to #5 on this list.

### 6. Lakewood

Arguably one of the best suburbs of Denver, Lakewood is the perfect place for those looking to strike a balance between the big city and the great outdoors. Located in the foothills, right in between downtown Denver and the mountains, Lakewood is scattered with open space parks which makes access to nature never more than just a few minutes away. With the world famous Red Rocks Amphitheatre just 15 minutes away in Morrison and Loveland ski resort just 35 minutes west on I-70, Lakewood truly is the perfect place for anyone looking to have the best of all worlds.

### 7. Grand Junction

The most western city in the state of Colorado and having a population of just over 60,000, Grand Junction thrives with a sense of solitude that can’t be found in any of the other cities on this list. Being far removed from other population centers, Grand Junction has a slow pace that often makes me feel as if I’ve gone back in time. Although this town is not a bustling city, they’ve enacted many initiatives to diversify their economy and to become a larger player on the national stage in the upcoming decades. This doesn’t only make Grand Junction an appealing place to live, but very practical as we all strive to balance work and play in our lives.

### Conclusion
Outdoor adventure, corporate careers, or everything in between, whatever brings you to Colorado you are sure to discover a place that's easy for you to call home. The best places to live in Colorado are consistently changing as our state continues to grow, the only way to know for sure where the best place is to live is to explore the towns for yourself.
