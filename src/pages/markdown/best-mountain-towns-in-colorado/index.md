The best mountain towns in Colorado are some of the most picturesque and cozy little towns in the United States. Surrounded by snowy peaks and dense forests, it’s obvious why these are such ideal places to be.

So what actually makes a mountain town the best? The views? The outdoor activities? The welcoming and laid back vibes?

Well, it’s a bit of everything together that gives these tiny communities the charm that we day dream about as we go about our daily routines.

 
## What are the best mountain towns in Colorado?
World class ski resorts and historic mining towns scattered across the magnificent Rocky Mountains in the western half of the state are the best mountain towns in Colorado. 

Some are known for their outdoor activities, others for their history, while some boast unique natural features such as hot springs.

In my years of chasing the deepest powder, the highest peaks, and the best cups of coffee I’ve had the opportunity to visit the vast majority of mountain towns in Colorado and I’ve put together this list to help others discover what makes Colorado so great.

 
**These are the best mountain towns in Colorado:**
### 1. Telluride

A world away from the populous front range, Telluride sits in the middle of the rugged San Juan mountain range at the far southwestern corner of the state. Being a long 6.5 hour drive from Denver  is likely how this town has been able to hold on to its unique charm over the years as many other towns have drastically changed.
 
### 2. Crested Butte

A town off the beaten path, Crested Butte once a sleepy mining town grew into one of the most popular ski resorts in the world during the 60’s as skiing grew in popularity. With steep mountains, rolling hills, and expansive valleys, Crested Butte is a mecca for adventurous sports and is well known for its extensive network of single track mountain biking trails. 
 
### 3. Steamboat Springs

Ski resorts and cute towns are easy to come by in Colorado, but to also boast numerous natural hot springs throughout the town is something unique to Steamboat Springs. After a long day of skiing on the mountain, there’s no better way to relax sore muscles than a long soak in hot natural mineral water. Strawberry Springs and Old Town Springs are the local favorites and are open to the public year round.
 
### 4. Grand Lake

The best place to relax and grab a drink after making the famous Trail Ridge Road drive through Rocky Mountain National Park, Grand Lake is a tiny community of just over 400 year round residents that offers small town hospitality like no other. Being such a small town nestled into the high alpine valleys gives this town a secluded and remote atmosphere that can be difficult to find elsewhere in the state.
 
### 5. Breckenridge

Boasting nearly 3,000 acres of skiable terrain and being just a 1.5 hour drive from Denver are likely why Breckenridge is one of the most popular destinations in Colorado. With over 1.5 million skiier visits each year, Breckenridge is a world class destination that welcomes people from around the globe. However, this amount of traffic makes Breckenridge extemely crowded during their busy seasons, which ultimately takes away from its charm and is why this town is #5 on the list.
 
### 6. Aspen

The arts, glam, and world class skiing are perhaps what make Aspen the most well known mountain town in the world. Reasonable living expenses and a down to Earth attitude would move this incredible town much higher up on this list. Being home to numerous world renowned music and film festivals make Aspen a true melting pot of foreign art and culture right in the middle of rugged ski country. 
 
### 7. Ouray

The most quiet and least visited town on this list, Ourary is an incredibly unique historic mining town tucked away into the narrow canyons of the San Juan mountain range. Self proclaimed as “the Switzerland of America”, there’s no reason to argue this after you witness the soaring peaks that rise above the town. For what Ouray lacks in skiing, it makes up for it with its long list of adventurous activities that can are not as common around the rest of the state such as 4x4 jeep tours, white water rafting, and world renowned ice climbing.
 
### 8. Estes Park

Much more than just “the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park”, Estes Park can hold its own with its breathtaking panoramic views, abundant wildlife, and variety of small town activities. The summer farmer’s market is a popular attraction as it offers the best opportunity to taste local foods and purchase hand made souvenirs. Just a few days in the town will almost guarantee you a few elk sightings and possibly even a black bear or two.
 
### 9. Leadville

Sitting at an elevation of 10,151 ft, your breath literally gets taken away as you gaze at the highest mountains in Colorado from the highest incorporated town in the United States, Leadville. The local economy here has been driven by mining since its inception and is to thank for this small town being able to fly under the radar as its more popular neighbors, Breckenridge and Vail, have exploded in growth over the years. 
 
### Conclusion
Hospitality, natural beauty, and healthy living are what make the best mountain towns in Colorado some of the most special places in the United States. With hundreds of communities scattered across Colorado’s Rocky Mountains, there are plenty more incredible places to be discovered that didn’t make it on this list. Regardless of the season, get out there and decide for yourself what are the best mountain towns in Colorado.
